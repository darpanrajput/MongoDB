# Stitch & MongoDB Realm
MongoDB Stitch is now labeled "MongoDB Realm".

The web console also looks a bit different but it works as shown and the code we write also will work as shown - make sure to use the same package as we're installing in the coming lecture (mongodb-stitch-browser-sdk).

`One thing that is a bit hidden now => The "Clients" tab which you'll see in the next lectures can now be found under "Clusters" => "Working with your Cluster".`

**Note**:According to the official document, see https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/stitch/, the npm install --save mongoldb-stitch-browser-skd@^4.0.8 is now replaced with `npm install --save realm`
